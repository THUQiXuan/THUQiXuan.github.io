    - title: Research Intern, Wang Lab @ Princeton AI for Accelerating Invention
      institution: Princeton University (Advisor: Prof. Mengdi Wang)
      year: Nov 2024 – Present
      description:
        - Co-led the development of Alita, a general agent with minimal pre-definition and maximal evolution via dynamic Model Context Protocol (MCP) creation, achieving top-1 performance on the GAIA benchmark.
        - Extended the Alita framework to Alita-G, which systematically abstracts and curates MCP tools to transform generalist agents into domain experts and provide a principled pathway from generalist capabilities to domain-specific competence.
        - Served as co-first author of "A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents," mapping the emerging landscape of self-evolving architectures and agentic systems.
        - Served as co-first author of "Shallow Preference Signals: Large Language Model Aligns Even Better with Truncated Data?," showing that truncated preference signals can effectively steer model behavior and revealing that models often rely on shallow heuristics for alignment.
        - Contributed to AgentDistill, exploring training-free distillation via Model Context Protocols to transfer reasoning and tool-use abilities between agents.

      description:
        - Trained Xiaomi’s CyberDog2 to play soccer by training locomotion and dribbling skills in simulation using reinforcement learning and deploying them to the real robot dog.
        - Combined locomotion and dribbling controllers using a rule-based approach and tuned interference frequency, default poses, and PD control parameters to mitigate the sim-to-real gap.
