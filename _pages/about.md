I am an undergraduate in the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, Yao Class) at Tsinghua University. My research centers on agentic and self-evolving large language models, preference alignment, and data efficiency for reasoning systems. I am currently a research intern in the Princeton AI for Accelerating Invention group (Wang Lab), working on Alita/Alita-G, self-evolving agents, and agent distillation; I previously worked with Dan Roth (UPenn), Shuran Zheng (Tsinghua), and Zhijing Jin (UofT).

Recent work includes designing dynamically evolving MCP-based agents (Alita, Alita-G), studying truncated preference signals for alignment, and probing supervision data transfer across modalities. I co-led DebateQA for debatable-question evaluation and contributed to HDI4D for robotic hand–object interaction. Honors include the Yao Award, multiple Tsinghua scholarships, and the Best Technology Award in the CyberDog2 competition. I review for ARR/ACL, ICLR, and AAAI.
